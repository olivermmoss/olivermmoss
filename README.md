## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Oliver Moss.

I'm currently an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science.  
My main programming experience in high school comes from game jam projects made in short time periods.  
I also have a larger game dev project that was abandoned in favor of furthering my studies.
