## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Oliver Moss.

I'm currently an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science.  

Check out my games at https://sscutoid.itch.io/ and the repositories listed here.

This summer (2025), I'm working with SAT solvers to attempt unsolved graph drawing problems in collaboration with CMU's Professor John Mackey and student Hasita Kamarlapudi.
